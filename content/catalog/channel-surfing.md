¶ **{{title}}** is a mezcal-fueled chaos in a glass, like a remote control on a tequila bender. Imagine flicking through vibrant, unpredictable flavors with each sip.

Mezcal's smoky swagger crashes through waves of maraschino sweetness and grenadine pops, only to be grounded by the herbal rebellion of dual amaros. The concoction balances on the edge of wild and refined, delivering a multi-sensory experience that's both riveting and complex.

A splash of lemon juice ensures you’re refreshingly disoriented, like finding clarity amidst TV static. This cocktail is an adventurous journey, inviting you to savor the unexpected and embrace the delicious disorder.
