¶ Imagine a boozy funnel straight to flavor town with no exits – that's the **{{title}}** for you.

With rye whiskey leading the charge, it's like a high-speed chase through a bitter-sweet labyrinth, escorted by Amaro's dark allure and Bonal Gentiane-Quina’s herbal funkiness.

Two dashes of Angostura bitters rev up the engine, adding mysterious whispers of spice, while an orange peel garnish flashes like hazard lights, cautioning you about the drink's dangerously smooth lanes. Buckle up, because this taste adventure is anything but boring.
