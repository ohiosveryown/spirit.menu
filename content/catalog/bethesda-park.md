¶ Welcome to the bad-boy of cocktails: **{{title}}**. This underdog mix plays rough with reposado tequila, flashing its wild side with a hint of mezcal smoke, just enough to make your taste buds keep guessing whether they’ve walked into a bonfire or a fiesta.

Sweet vermouth cacao chimes in like a sultry troubadour whispering forbidden tales, tying the ensemble together with a smooth, cocoa-kissed melody.

Dashes of orange bitters cut through the haze, adding a zesty kick like a rebel yell in the heat of the night. An orange twist dances on the rim, the final rebellious flourish in this symphony of chaos. Sip it slow, cowboy; this cocktail is a masterclass in recklessness and sophistication intertwined.
